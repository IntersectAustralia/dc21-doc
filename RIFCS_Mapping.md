# RIF-CS Mapping

The full mapping from Diver to RIF-CS (and suggestions for mappings in RedBox) was documented for the HIEv for MODC project and can be found [here](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/dc21-doc/blob/master/files/RIF-CS%20Mapping/HIEv_RB%20Data%20Model%20Changes.xlsx).

Example RIF-CS for the new elements can be found [here](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/dc21-doc/blob/master/files/RIF-CS%20Mapping/HIEv%20sample%20RIFCS%20v3.docx).
